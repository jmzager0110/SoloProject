Initial Project Repository
This is my Solo Project for LiftOff.

Originally, I had intended to base my project around learning Spring Boot JDBC, but I decided to start over with a base project built off of Spring Boot JPA.
I decided to pare down my expectations of myself, to begin with something I am more familiar with (JPA), then focus on the other technologies I want to learn, 
such as Boot Strap, Sass, and go from there!

This project will hopefully end with an app that will allow users to create accounts, then to create events (Meet Ups), and give attendees the option to vote on when and where.
The idea is that a group of people can vote on these options, saving everyone from the back-and-forth of their indecisive friends. Once the results are in, the event administrator 
would be able to send the results to the attendees via email.
